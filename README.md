# gdFFMPEG

This is a Godot FFMPEG implementation via GDNative.    
  
You can play any video file supported by FFMPEG which is most files, unlike Godot which only supports Ogg natively.
  
Currently it only works for Windows, I have supplied the compiled binaries for Linux too but can't get it to work correctly if anyone wants to check for a fix they can.
